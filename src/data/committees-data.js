export const UNSC =
  "United Nations Security Council is a selected nations committee, not having much strength in numbers; but holding the most decision-making powers. The Security Council was created after World War II to deal with the failings of the previous international organization, the League Of Nations, in sustaining world peace. The Security Council takes the lead in determining the existence of danger. Having only 15 members, each with one vote, this committee deliberates to ensure international peace and security. For expert MUNners, this is the best choice! From 1919 to 1991, Ukraine was part of the USSR. But since Ukraine's independence, Russia has expressed the desire to reunite the two. Ukraine has tried to move away from Russian influence, attempting to join the EU and becoming a partner country to NATO. Now Putin is trying to intimidate Ukraine by putting troops near the border with an invasion looming. With around 24,000 deaths and almost 10 million displaced, this is a tremendous concern. There's only destruction that has been the outcome of the wars, nothing else. Now, the world waits. Fingers crossed."

export const IMF =
  "International Monetary Fund is a UN specialized agency that nurtures economic growth and employment by providing temporary monetary assistance to countries to help ease the balance of payments adjustment and technical assistance. It was founded in 1944 to stabilize currency exchange rates and expand international liquidity. The IMF is headed by a board of governors, each of whom represents one of the organization’s approximately 180 member states. The fund’s day-to-day operations are administered by an executive board, which consists of 24 executive directors who meet at least three times a week. Eight directors represent individual countries (China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and the other 16 represent the fund’s remaining members, grouped by world regions. The board is chaired by a managing director, who is appointed by the board for a renewable five-year term. Cryptocurrency has emerged as an area of keen interest worldwide and stated that digital currency has changed the way we look at money, it has secured the special attention of investors. Also, this boon for the digital currency is leading to increasing rates of cyber fraud and manipulating financial markets."

export const DISEC =
  'The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) is a UN committee that focuses on global matters of war and peace, the arms and ammunition possessed by various nations, and the necessary actions to evade international disruption of security. With diverse agendas focusing on security and border policies of different countries, this is the most sought-after committee at JECRC MUN for past editions. The delegates represent various countries and argue the sanity of their policies while simultaneously fitting their ideologies into the worldview of the issues. The Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the committee ensure that the discussions are agenda-centric and do not breach the code of conduct of the United Nations General Assembly. Terrorism has assumed prime focus among the many themes, and discussions have spoken liberally for the pros and cons to the forefront. A biological attack, or bioterrorism, is the intentional release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or crops. Bioterrorism is the most worrying and dangerous issue that has come to light recently. Countries are secretly manufacturing bioweapons that are of great concern to humanity. Actions are needed to be taken to keep matters in hand as this might be the eleventh hour for the whole world that stands before a crisis.'

export const SC =
  "Unlike other committees, this is a special committee whose sole motive is fun and drama. The participants will discuss the agenda-The Sokovia Accords: Framework for the Registration and Deployment of Enhanced Individuals. Avengers is one of the most popular superhero movies in the world based on Marvel comics and has captivated the audience of diverse age groups. The Sokovia Accords are a version of the Superhuman Registration Act from the Civil War comic series. The Act is a piece of legislation that required all enhanced individuals in the United States of America to reveal their secret identities and disclose their powers for regulation. It was basically government tampering with the discretion of the Avengers, and some avengers were in favor of the clause, whereas some thought otherwise, which led to a Civil War."
