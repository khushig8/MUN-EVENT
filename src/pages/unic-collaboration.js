                  The Zero Hour Summit aims to center the voices of our college youth in the conversation about national and international issues and environmental justice. We intend to develop a discussion platform for topics of public interest that requires urgent attention.
                  Zero Hour Summit is going to be an in-house debate competition that is bound to discuss 4 agendas. Agendas do not matter to a man without thought but torture the hearts of people who actively think about this world we live in.
                  With these debates, we aim to move our students towards constant growth and development in thinking, research, and speaking skills, and the ability to have a sound opinion about matters of interest.

                <br />
                Since its establishment, Reservation System in the country has played a major role in every field, from education to jobs. While playing a beneficial role in equalling the field for all the communities and providing opportunities to the underprivileged, the system has also become a curse for the rest of the community and the nation itself. 
This agenda deals with the two faces of our reservation system- deciding whether itâ€™s a gift that should be savored or a bane that should be abolished for the future of our citizens and the country.

                With the Internet now available in every nook and corner of the world, it raises a vital question for everyone- the privacy of data. Although sharing of data to websites and their parent companies makes it easier to get recommendations and gives it a more personalized look, leaks of personal information can cause both physical and mental anguish to the users. 
This agenda is a take on both the positive and negative aspects of how the privatization of data to the users themselves would affect them for better or for worse.

Millennials (born between 1982 and 2000) and Gen Z (born between 2001 and 2019), have different opinions and places in their lives due to technology, education, self-identity, society, upbringing, communication, and emotions. 
The agenda raises a series of queries and aspects to marvel on- which side are you on?

                Artificial intelligence is a new and up-and-coming technology capable of changing the world as we know it. It is the simulation of human intelligence processed by machines that can be the cause of mass destruction, a robot uprising, or the settlement of a new and improved civilization. This revolution in technology would impact us all, for good or bad. This agenda gives the participants an opportunity to debate on topics such as human error, new inventions, the high cost of creation, unemployment, technology improvement, human activity, and so on.
