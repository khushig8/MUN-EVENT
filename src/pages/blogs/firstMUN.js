                  Model United Nations need a lot of pre-preparations if you
                  want to succeed at it. Before your first MUN, anxiety and
                  excitement are at an all time high. The pressure of
                  performance is there. But there is so much for you to look
                  forward to. Meet new people and have interesting
                  conversations. Your first delegate experience will hold
                  everything in proportion. With dopamine and adrenaline rushing
                  in your veins, it will be memorable for you. You will carry
                  back home a bundle of knowledge and acquaintance of people
                  from across the country, or even the world.

                  The proceedings of the committee begin with a discussion of
                  the Rules of Procedure by the Executive Board. The chair and
                  the vice-chair formally begin the session and open the
                  discussion as per the principles. This is your time to speak
                  and deliberate. Amidst the many sessions that will be
                  conducted, the first one is important as you get a chance to
                  create a great first impression. What remains necessary is to
                  not feel intimidated by your fellow delegates. You might be
                  awestruck by other’s diplomacy and tactics, but don’t forget
                  to lose your ground. There are all sorts of inexperienced and
                  experienced people at MUN, but you should be determined to
                  work your way up.

                  The lunch and dinner time would serve as more rounds of
                  socializing. You can bring up discussions about the sessions
                  or simply have some light chat with your mates. Every session
                  brings a fresh chance to outshine your previous performance.
                  Self-improvement is the key. There can be times you might feel
                  tongue-tied or but slowly you will learn to regain composure
                  and give intelligent replies. Doing MUN is an art, and at
                  first no artist has any idea about the masterpiece he is
                  beginning to create.

                  The closing ceremony will keep you stressed. If you have given
                  satisfactory performance, your fingers will remain crossed for
                  an award or a special mention. The cheers and applause will
                  fuel your desire. If not this time, the closing ceremony would
                  inspire you to work better in the next MUN. The socials at the
                  end have always done a great job to release all the worry of
                  the conference. Have a gala time here!
